## Implementation of hypergraph topology and hypergraph traversal algorithms (with relaxation) 

The algorithms presented here are outlined in depth in Franzese N, Groce A, Murali TM, Ritz A (2019) Hypergraph-based connectivity measures for signaling pathway topologies. PLOS Computational Biology 15(10): e1007384. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007384. 

To find the Python implementation of the same algorithms see: https://github.com/Murali-group/halp/blob/annabranch/halp/algorithms/directed_paths.py

### Requirements for running code: 
1. Java SE 14
